- If you wish to add the entire file to the context, simply choose the "AI Chat: Add to Context" option without highlighting any code within the editor.
- Content of _document popups_ can be also added as a context. Just click the "More" button located in the bottom-right corner on the popup and select "AI Chat: Add to Context" action.
- Multiple code snippets can be either added or removed before forwarding all snippets and a prompt to the chatbot.
